x - When receiving a barcode

	x - If the barcode is valid and we have a price for it display that price

	x - If the barcode is not known -> "No price found"

	x - null -> "Invalid barcode"

	x - string.Empty -> "Invalid barcode"

When selling multiple items

	x - Show the total price when "total is clicked"

		Sell 1 item and show total
		Sell 3 items and all are found
		Sell 3 items and 2 are found
		Sell 3 items and none are found

	x - As a cashier, I need to be able to input a price manually if not found by the system

	x - As a price manager I need to be notified when a price is not found for a product so that I can update the price list
