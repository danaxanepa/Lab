When receiving a barcode

	If the barcode is valid and we have a price for it display that price

	If the barcode is not known -> "No price found"

	null -> "Invalid barcode"

	string.Empty -> "Invalid barcode"

When selling multiple items

	Show the total price when "total is clicked"

		Sell 3 items and all are found
		Sell 3 items and 2 are found
		Sell 3 items and none are found

	As a cashier, I need to be able to input a price manually if not found by the system

	As a price manager I need to be notified when a price is not found for a product so that I can update the price list
